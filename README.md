This repository is for the problem sets provided by the MIT 6.0001 INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER SCIENCE AND PROGRAMMING IN PYTHON course. All the problem descriptions and other information can be found at their website:

There's the same course on EDX that is the same but has different lecturers and problems I believe. Idk much about it otherwise.

The final problem set ps5.py remains unfinished. This is because the supporting code (RSS feed parser, mkTinker, project_util) are outdated and do not work. I hope that in the future I'll be able to make my own supporting code and complete the code on my own.
